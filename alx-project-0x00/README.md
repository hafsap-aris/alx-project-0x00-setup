# Next.js Web Application ‚Äì Learning Project

## üìò Project Description
This project is a comprehensive **Next.js** web application that demonstrates core concepts of modern web development. It features multiple pages for displaying posts and users, with interactive components for adding new content. Built using **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Next.js**, it showcases best practices in component-based architecture, state management, and API integration.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

- Set up a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Implement dynamic page routing and navigation
- Create reusable React components with proper TypeScript typing
- Work with external APIs to fetch and display data
- Implement modal dialogs for user interaction
- Understand static site generation with `getStaticProps`
- Manage component state with React hooks
- Structure a project with proper directory organization
- Apply responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Component Architecture
- Follow atomic design principles
- Separate presentational and container components
- Create reusable UI components (Button, Card, Modal)

### Type Safety
- Define TypeScript interfaces
- Type all props and state
- Handle event types correctly

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Implement responsive design

### State Management
- Use React hooks for local state
- Lift state up when needed
- Keep state minimal and focused

### Project Structure
- Organize components by feature/domain
- Centralize interfaces
- Follow Next.js conventions for pages

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes
- Uses JSONPlaceholder as a mock API
- Static generation (`getStaticProps`) for initial data fetching
- Modals demonstrate interactive UI patterns
- TypeScript ensures type safety
- Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling
